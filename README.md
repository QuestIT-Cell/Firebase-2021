# Firebase Workshop 2021
In the first workshop conducted by Quest IT, Devdutta and Srajan take us through Firebase.

## Day 1

Devdutta explains the concept of having a database on the cloud, about no-SQL databases and the document-based pattern of storing data. We then create a simple application using HTML and JavaScript which uses Firebase as its backend.

## To run this - 

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a project on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
3. Create a collection of ```items``` in the Cloud Firestore.
4. Add your Firebase credentials in the ```firebaseConfig``` object in ```src/config.js``` file.
5. You can un-comment and run the commented code in ```src/database.js``` to see how you can get, set, insert, delete and update documents from the Client Side and also see how to subscribe to a Web-socket from Firebase to get a snapshot object. 
6. You can open up index.html using the **Live Server** Extension of Visual Studio code and view the results in the JavaScript Debug Console.

PS: All the files are availabe here for reference
It is recommended try to code by yourself.
Thank you!
