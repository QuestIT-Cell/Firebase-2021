# Firebase Workshop 2021
In the first workshop conducted by Quest IT, Devdutta and Srajan take us through Firebase.

## Day 2

After Devdutta covered the different aspects of Firebase viz. viewing and making changes to a Cloud FireStore Database from a JavaScript Client.
In Day 2 of the Workshop, Srajan takes you through integrating Firebase with React.js where he builds a simple To-Do List Application with Firebase Auth and also deploy the React Project with Firebase.
